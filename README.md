# py-gdax

py-gdax is a simple implementation of REST API for https://www.gdax.com/. I am making this for fun, and as a basis for my own future projects. I would not recommend using py-gdax if you are looking for something bug free. I would only recommend you use py-gdax as a learning tool as to how to build your own python API wrapper.
